## Overview

Currently researching data sources and available data to narrow down project topic. Will return by Thursday with suggestions for the group and final decisions.

Update from 4/19/22 class (Kit's comments in Slack):

With the advice of Felipe, the dataset we were working with was going to be more trouble than what it is worth. The demographic information would not be a good predictor due to limited to no correlation with what we were trying to predict. The rest of the questions/columns could maybe be used but it would require a lot of cleaning and even after that the data is very unbalanced. This would lead to other problems down the road when trying to make a good model. Anyways, we have been spending most of class trying to find another dataset. We haven't been able to find another good sleep one so since we are back at square one we were thinking it may be a good idea to try and pivot to a different topic. We were thinking we would meet tomorrow at some point so we can decide on a new dataset that way we can have all of class Thursday to catch back up.

To summarize (Sharon's interpretation):  the data has too much disimilarity between the sleep alone/sleep together groups (est to be 20%/80%) for meaningful analysis beyond supervised learning cluster analysis, that the demographics correlation was doubtful without initial analysis, and that the predictability of the sleep apart reason variables would be with extremely messy data and small sample sizes.

Before 4/21 class, we need to find a different database to work with and make some decisions about our project plan.

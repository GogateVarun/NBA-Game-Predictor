# Team-3-Project

Our group is attempting to create an algorithm that can be used to preidct your sleep-partner patterns. By prompting for user inputs of gender, age, household income, education level, and geopgraphic location, the algorithm will determine how often someone will sleep alone in their next relationship.

## Communication Plan

Members have agreed to utilize all methods available. This includes our group's Slack channel, our email addresses, Zoom, Google Meet, and class time. In order to stay updated on the status of each of our parts of the project, we message each other regularly through Slack and zoom meetings.

## Overview

Project Question: Can demographic information be used to predict sleep-partner patterns?

## Resources

Our dataset was discovered through [data.world](https://data.world/fivethirtyeight/sleeping-alone-data/workspace/file?filename=sleeping-alone-data.csv). In it's original state, the data contains 1,094 rows with 31 fields. Using the "Sleep-Alone-Data", we will reduce fields significantly from 31 to 8, keeping the demographic data in the final fields, as well as, the field regarding how often partners sleep in separate beds. Using the demographic data, we will develop a Machine Learning algorithm that can hopefully predict how often someone will sleep alone in their next relationship.

## Storyboard/Next Steps

Currently have located a dataset and generated a question to attempt to answer.
Next Steps include:
- Cleaning the dataset using Python and Pandas to filter out empty rows and unnecessary columns
- Exploring PostgreSQL database structure for housing data and tracking log of user inputs
- Beginning to develop Machine Learning algorithm
- Continue to build dashboard framework as analysis and model take shape
